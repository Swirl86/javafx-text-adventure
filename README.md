# QuestBound – JavaFX Text-Based Adventure

**QuestBound** is a text-based adventure game built using **JavaFX**.  
The game allows players to explore rooms, interact with items, and make choices through typed commands.

My main purpose of this project is to learn and improve my Java skills, particularly with JavaFX, object-oriented programming, and GUI development.

## Features

- Interactive story with rooms and items
- Player stats (health, inventory)
- Command input via GUI
- Expandable to include quests, combat, and save/load

## Technology

- Java 17
- JavaFX 21
- Maven for dependency management and build

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Swirl86/javafx-text-adventure.git
cd javafx-text-adventure
```

Build and run with Maven:
```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

## Future Improvements

- Inventory system
- Multiple rooms and quests
- Save/load game functionality
- Enhanced UI with ControlsFX / BootstrapFX
